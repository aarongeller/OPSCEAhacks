function split = splitbrain(cortex, orientation, b, m)
% Splits the brain and exports a mesh that is a subset of the original
% mesh. Requires the function splitFV (Matlab Exchange)
%
%
% INPUTS:
% cortex - the original mesh. a structure containing tri and vert 
% 
% orientation - slice orientation ('c', 'a', 's', or 'oc'), with
% slices defined as follows, for axes defined medial/lateral = X
% axis, anterior/posterior = Y axis, inferior/superior = Z axis:
%
% c (coronal): defined by a line in the XY plane, angle near n*pi
%              for n in integers including zero
% a (axial): defined by a line in the XZ plane
% s (sagittal): defined by a line in the XZ plane, angle near
%               n*pi/2 for n in integers excluding zero
% oc (oblique coronal): defined by a line in the YZ plane
%
% b- intercept
%
% m- slope
%
% OUTPUTS:
% split - a new mesh split at the specified point. A structure containing
% tri and vert
